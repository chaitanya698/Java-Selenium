# Singleton Design Pattern Example

Please refere the "TestSingleton.java" for the singleton design pattern example

# Rules for Singleton class

 * 1. The Constructor of the class must be declared as Private, so that it can not be instantiated outside the class.
 * 2. Declare a Static reference variable for the class, so that it is available globally
 * 3. Declare a Static method with return type as the object of the class and this method 
 * should check which should check if class is already instantiated once.
 * If so it should return the same object, else create a new one.
